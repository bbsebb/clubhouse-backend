/**
 * Represents the data access mechanism to fetch, persist, and manipulate {@link Coach} entities.
 * <p>
 * This repository abstracts the persistence details of the Coach entities. It offers methods to access and manipulate
 * the underlying coach data based on both the unique identifier (`id`) and the unique name, which also serves as a primary key.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Functionalities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Search for a specific coach based on its unique name.</li>
 *   <li>Search for a specific coach based on its unique UUID identifier.</li>
 *   <li>Persist a coach entity to the data store or update it if it already exists.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * CoachRepository repository = ...;  // Instance of the repository (could be obtained via dependency injection, etc.)
 * Optional<Coach> johnDoeOpt = repository.findByKeys("John Doe");
 * Optional<Coach> specificCoachOpt = repository.findById(UUID.fromString("some-uuid-string"));
 * Coach newCoach = new Coach(UUID.randomUUID(), "Jane Smith", new PhoneNumber("0987654321"));
 * repository.save(newCoach);
 * }
 * </pre>
