/**
 * Represents the data access mechanism to fetch, persist, and manipulate {@link Team} entities.
 * <p>
 * This repository offers an abstraction over the persistence layer for `Team` entities. It provides
 * methods to retrieve team instances based on specific criteria, such as the combination of the club,
 * gender, category, and team number, or based on a unique identifier (ID). It also supports retrieval
 * of all teams and saving/updating a team entity.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Functionalities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Search for a specific team based on a combination of club, gender, category, and team number.</li>
 *   <li>Retrieve all teams present in the database/system.</li>
 *   <li>Search for teams based on specific category and gender names.</li>
 *   <li>Search for a team using its unique identifier (ID).</li>
 *   <li>Save or update a specific team entity.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * TeamRepository repository = ...;  // Obtain an instance of the repository (e.g., via dependency injection).
 * Optional<Team> teamOpt = repository.findByKeys(clubInstance, Gender.MALE, categoryInstance, 1);
 * Team newTeam = new Team(UUID.randomUUID(), categoryInstance, Gender.FEMALE, 2, clubInstance, TeamsColor.BLUE, coachInstance);
 * repository.save(newTeam);
 * }
