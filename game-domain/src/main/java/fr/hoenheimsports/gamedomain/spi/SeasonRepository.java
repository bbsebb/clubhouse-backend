/**
 * Represents the data access mechanism to fetch, persist, and manipulate {@link Season} entities.
 * <p>
 * This repository offers an abstraction over the persistence layer for `Season` entities. It provides
 * methods to retrieve season instances based on specific criteria, like the date a game occurs or
 * the unique identifier (name) of a season.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Functionalities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Search for a specific season where a particular date falls.</li>
 *   <li>Search for a specific season using its unique identifier (name).</li>
 *   <li>Save or update a specific season entity.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * SeasonRepository repository = ...;  // Obtain an instance of the repository (e.g., via dependency injection).
 * Optional<Season> seasonOpt = repository.findByDate(LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 15));
 * Season newSeason = new Season("SEASON_2023_2024", LocalDate.of(2023, 8, 1), LocalDate.of(2024, 7, 31));
 * repository.save(newSeason);
 * }
 * </pre>
