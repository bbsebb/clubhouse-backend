 * Represents the data access mechanism to fetch, persist, and manipulate {@link Competition} entities.

 * <h2>Core Functionalities:</h2>

 *   <li>Search for a specific competition based on its unique name.</li>
 *   <li>Persist a competition entity to the data store or update it if it already exists.</li>

 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * CompetitionRepository repository = ...;  // Instance of the repository (could be obtained via dependency injection, etc.)
 * Optional<Competition> footballOpt = repository.findById("Football");
 * Competition newCompetition = new Competition("Basketball");
